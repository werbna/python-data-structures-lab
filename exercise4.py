# Create a dictionary named home_town containing the keys of city, state, and population.
# Using the home_town dictionary, assign to a variable named home_town_message a string with this format: “I was born in <city>, <state> - population of <population>”

def hometown_info():
    home_town = {'city': 'San Diego', 'state': 'California', 'population': 1381000}
    home_town_message = f'I was born in {home_town["city"]}, {home_town["state"]} - population of {home_town["population"]}'
    return home_town_message

# Call the function and print the result
