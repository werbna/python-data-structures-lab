# Exercise 3: Slicing Tuples
#
# Using the slice operator, assign a new tuple containing only the last two food strings in the foods to a variable named last_two_foods.

def slice_foods():
    foods = 'steak', 'fries', 'soda'
    last_two_foods = foods[-2:]
    return last_two_foods

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 3:', slice_foods())
